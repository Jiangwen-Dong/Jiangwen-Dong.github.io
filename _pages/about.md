I am a phd student in PolyU, under the supervision of Prof. Wanyu Lin.

## Research Interest
I develop graph-driven multi-agent systems that enable efficient, adaptive, and distributed LLM reasoning across edge–cloud environments. My research integrates graph intelligence, multi-agent collaboration, and efficient distributed systems to build AI that is:
- Structured (graph-based reasoning)
- Collaborative (multi-agent LLMs)
- Efficient (edge–cloud computation)
- Adaptive (continual and personalized learning)
